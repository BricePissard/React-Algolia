Question 1:
Hello,
I'm new to search engines, and there are a lot of concepts I'm not educated on.
To make my onboarding smoother, it'd help if you could provide me with some
definitions of the following concepts:
- Records
- Indexing
I'm also struggling with understanding what types of metrics would be useful to
include in the "Custom Ranking."
Cheers, George

Answer 1:
Hi George,
first of all thanks for contacting Algolia, for database concerns you're in good hands.
Regarding your questions:
- A record is the name given to the data you've stored in a database and it is
structured as pair of key/value.
If you're familiar with Excel let say that a record is the value of a cell.
- An index is a set of technics that facilitate the access to a given data on a database.
When you place an index on a database field, it modify the place where the data is
stored and the its hierarchy structure to speed-up the search requests.
Algolia is here to simplify your work to not have to worry about technology.

Question 2:
Hello,
Sorry to give you the kind of feedback that I know you do not want to hear,
but I really hate the new dashboard design. Clearing and deleting indexes are
now several clicks away. I am needing to use these features while iterating,
so this is inconvenient.
Regards, Matt

Answer 2:
Hi Matt,
We are very sorry here at Algolia to hear that some of our users are not satisfy

Question 3:
Hi,
I'm looking to integrate Algolia in my website. Will this be a lot of development
work for me? What's the high level process look like?
Regards, Leo

Answer 3:
Hi Leo,
first of all thanks for contacting Algolia, for database concerns you're in good hands.
Algolia provides a set of tools and services to easily integrate database request
for small and large companies.
If the data you want to manage through Algolia is small (<500Mo) and simply structured
(<10 tables) the integration process will be simple (around a couple of hour to have it done).
The more your data get wide and diversely structured the more the level of integration
will be high.
I suggest you to have a look to our Tutorial and API to see what can be done and how:

For the majority of our users the integration of Algolia is very simple and the
benefits for you are enormous so give it a try!
Thanks for trusting Algolia,
Brice
