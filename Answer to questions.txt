Question 1:
Hello,
I'm new to search engines, and there are a lot of concepts I'm not educated on.
To make my onboarding smoother, it'd help if you could provide me with some
definitions of the following concepts:
- Records
- Indexing
I'm also struggling with understanding what types of metrics would be useful to
include in the "Custom Ranking."
Cheers, George

Answer 1:
Hi George,
first of all thanks for contacting Algolia, for database concerns you're in good hands.
Regarding your questions:

- An index is the name given to place where you store your data in Algolia.
An index in Algolia is similar to a table in a database.

- A record is the name given to the data objects you've stored in an Algolia Index.
A record in Algolia is similar to a row result in a database request.
The records are structured as pair of key/value, Algolia store the data in JSON format.
Each records are optimized to speed-up the searching, filtering and ranking request.

Algolia is here to simplify your work to not have to worry about technology,
here is the description of Indexes and Records:

Regarding the "Custom Ranking" it depends on your records structure and on your
relevant business metrics to reorder.
"Custom Ranking" allows you to reorder your results based on a second parameter.
See the documentation and tutorial:

Question 2:
Hello,
Sorry to give you the kind of feedback that I know you do not want to hear,
but I really hate the new dashboard design. Clearing and deleting indexes are
now several clicks away. I am needing to use these features while iterating,
so this is inconvenient.
Regards, Matt

Answer 2:
Hi Matt,
We are very sorry here at Algolia to hear that some of our users are not satisfy

We have updated our interface based on several pointers that show us that most of

We really take care of all the opinions, could you dig your problem description

Question 3:
Hi,
I'm looking to integrate Algolia in my website. Will this be a lot of development
work for me? What's the high level process look like?
Regards, Leo

Answer 3:
Hi Leo,
first of all thanks for contacting Algolia, for database concerns you're in good hands.
Algolia provides a set of tools and services to easily integrate database request
for small and large companies.
If the data you want to manage through Algolia is small (<500Mo) and simply structured
(<10 tables) the integration process will be simple (around a couple of hours to have it done).
The more your data get wide and diversely structured the more the level of integration
will be high.
I suggest you to have a look to our Tutorial and API to see what can be done and how:
https://www.algolia.com/doc/tutorials/
You can also have a look to our API documentation to see how you can connect your
existing code with Algolia:
https://www.algolia.com/doc/api-reference/
For the majority of our users the integration of Algolia is very simple and the
benefits for you are enormous so give it a try!
Thanks for trusting Algolia,
Brice
